# Kaggle Flood Prediction Competition

This repository contains the materials related to our participation in the Kaggle competition **["Regression with a Flood Prediction Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e5)**.

## Overview

We competed in the Kaggle flood prediction challenge, developing machine learning models to forecast flood occurrences. This repository includes our code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

### What You Will Find Here:

- **`Blog2_Regression_with_a_Flood_Prediction_Dataset.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with complete code for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, tuning, and evaluation.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the repository contents and directory structure.
